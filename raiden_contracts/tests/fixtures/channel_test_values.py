# We must cover the edge cases documented in
# https://github.com/raiden-network/raiden-contracts/issues/188
# The scope is to make sure that if someone uses an old balance proof, this cannot be used as
# an attack to steal tokens.
# For invalid balance proofs (created and signed with an unofficial Raiden client),
# we cannot determine and guarantee corectness. There are specific constraints that the
# Raiden client must enforce that guarantee correctness.

# For all valid last balance proofs provided we have manually constructed a suit of old balance
# proof pairs that could be used for attacks (documented edge cases).
# We will test that using old balance proofs does not result in cheating, therefore the attacker
# (participant who provides the old balance proof) must not receive more tokens than in the case
# where he provides a `valid last` balance proof.
